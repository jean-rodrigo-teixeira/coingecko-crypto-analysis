# Project: Cryptocurrency Data Collection

This project aims to collect data about various cryptocurrencies using the public API from [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api), store the information in an Excel file, and create a foundation for future analyses. The script collects historical price data for cryptocurrencies such as **Bitcoin**, **Ethereum**, **Ripple**, **Litecoin**, and others, over the last 365 days, as well as metadata about these cryptocurrencies.

## Project Files

1. **`crypto_data.xlsx`**: Excel file generated by the script, containing the following data:
   - **`Coin_ID_and_Name` sheet**: Contains the ID and name of the collected cryptocurrencies.
   - **`Coin_Metadata` sheet**: Contains metadata about the cryptocurrencies, such as the current price (in USD), market cap, supply, and max supply.
   - **`Coin_Price_Data` sheet**: Contains the historical prices of the cryptocurrencies, including the timestamp and the price (in USD) for each day over the last 365 days.

2. **`extract_crypto_data.py`**: Python script responsible for:
   - Making requests to the CoinGecko API to collect historical price data and metadata.
   - Processing the returned data (converting timestamps to readable dates).
   - Saving the extracted data into an Excel file (**`crypto_data.xlsx`**).

## Features

- Collects historical price data for **Bitcoin**, **Ethereum**, **Ripple**, **Litecoin**, and other cryptocurrencies over the last 365 days.
- Collects metadata for cryptocurrencies, such as current price, market cap, supply, and max supply.
- Converts timestamps provided by the API into readable dates.
- Saves the data in Excel format, with three sheets: `Coin_ID_and_Name`, `Coin_Metadata`, and `Coin_Price_Data`.

## How to Use

Make sure you have the following packages installed:

- `requests`
- `pandas`
- `openpyxl` (to save data in Excel format)
