# Project: Cryptocurrency Data Collection

This project aims to collect data about various cryptocurrencies using the public API from [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api), store the information in an Excel file, and create a foundation for future analyses. The script collects historical price data for cryptocurrencies such as **Bitcoin**, **Ethereum**, **Ripple**, **Litecoin**, and others, over the last 365 days, as well as metadata about these cryptocurrencies.

## Project Files

1. **`crypto_data.xlsx`**: Excel file generated by the script, containing the following data:
   - **`Coin_ID_and_Name` sheet**: Contains the ID and name of the collected cryptocurrencies.
   - **`Coin_Metadata` sheet**: Contains metadata about the cryptocurrencies, such as the current price (in USD), market cap, supply, and max supply.
   - **`Coin_Price_Data` sheet**: Contains the historical prices of the cryptocurrencies, including the timestamp and the price (in USD) for each day over the last 365 days.

2. **`extract_crypto_data.py`**: Python script responsible for:
   - Making requests to the CoinGecko API to collect historical price data and metadata.
   - Processing the returned data (converting timestamps to readable dates).
   - Saving the extracted data into an Excel file (**`crypto_data.xlsx`**).

3. **`crypto_data.pbix`**: Power BI file that allows us to visualize the collected cryptocurrency data. The Power BI file includes:
   - **Power Query Transformations**: This part of the process involves loading the `crypto_data.xlsx` file into Power BI, processing and transforming the data using Power Query. Key transformations include converting Unix timestamps into readable dates, filtering data for specific times, and changing the column types to ensure accurate visualizations.
   - **Data Modeling**: The transformed data is structured in a way that allows easy creation of reports and dashboards.
   - **Visualizations**: The Power BI dashboard visualizes the historical price trends of cryptocurrencies, including daily price fluctuations, and allows users to explore the collected metadata.

## Features

- Collects historical price data for **Bitcoin**, **Ethereum**, **Ripple**, **Litecoin**, and other cryptocurrencies over the last 365 days.
- Collects metadata for cryptocurrencies, such as current price, market cap, supply, and max supply.
- Converts timestamps provided by the API into readable dates.
- Saves the data in Excel format, with three sheets: `Coin_ID_and_Name`, `Coin_Metadata`, and `Coin_Price_Data`.
- **Power BI Integration**:
  - Power BI integrates with the **`crypto_data.xlsx`** file, applying necessary transformations (such as date conversion and type changes).
  - The data is visualized in an easy-to-understand dashboard format, with customizable filters and metrics for analyzing cryptocurrency trends.

## How to Use

### Requirements

Make sure you have the following packages installed:

- `requests`
- `pandas`
- `openpyxl` (to save data in Excel format)
- Power BI (for creating and viewing the `crypto_data.pbix` file)

You can install the Python dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install requests pandas openpyxl
